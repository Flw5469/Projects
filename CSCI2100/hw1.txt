Q1
Accept a line.
Use a stack. Read character from the line one by one.
If it is open, push it in stack.
If it is close, pop one from stack and compare them,if they are different then count as one more action need to be done.If fail to pop any , it means it is impossible for a perfect blanket.
At last if something is left in stack, it means impossible.



Q2
Read numbers into a array that set by total number of customers.
Keep looping the array from 1 to n, decrease each of the customer's need by m.
If customer's need is originally higher than zero, but lower or equal to zero after decrease, count one more person is finished.
Until the count equals to total number of customers, output the last position served.





Q3
The Compare process is:
"Using 4 hash tables containing ALL  prefix,suffix of input array 1 and all middle parts of input array 1 and 2.
Compare ALL input array 2's suffix and prefix with the tables
Compare the whole input array 1 and 2 with ALL the middle parts to check for one string containing another."
Compare array 1,2.
If array 1 and 2 can be combined then combine them and compare the new array with array 3.
If they can't, merge them as 12 and 21 and compare both of them with array 3.
If any array can be combined with array 3 then cocmbine them.
If no just add them together.
Output the shortest length of multiple array OR output the length of the only combined array.
